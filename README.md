# Employee Attrition Prediction using RNN

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical concern for organizations, as it impacts productivity, morale, and costs. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly RNNs, this project aims to provide an effective solution to anticipate employee turnover and enable proactive retention strategies.

## Introduction

Employee attrition can arise due to various factors such as job dissatisfaction, better opportunities, or organizational changes. Understanding the patterns and predictors of attrition allows organizations to mitigate risks and improve employee satisfaction.

This project implements a deep learning model using RNNs to predict employee attrition based on historical data. The RNN architecture is well-suited for sequential and time-dependent data, making it a powerful choice for this problem.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.
- **Model Training:** Employs RNN with customizable layers and parameters.
- **Visualization:** Provides insights through visualizations of feature importance and model performance.
- **Prediction:** Outputs attrition likelihood for individual employees.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- Employee demographics (age, gender, marital status, etc.)
- Job-related attributes (job role, department, salary, etc.)
- Work environment factors (working hours, job satisfaction, etc.)
- Performance metrics (performance rating, promotions, etc.)

> Note: Ensure the dataset is properly anonymized to comply with privacy regulations.

## Model Architecture

The RNN model is designed with the following components:

- **Input Layer:** Processes the preprocessed feature set.
- **Recurrent Layers:** Includes LSTM or GRU units for sequential data processing.
- **Dense Layer:** Maps learned features to the output space.
- **Output Layer:** Produces a binary prediction (attrition or no attrition).
